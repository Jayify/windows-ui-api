# windows-ui-api

This repository is dedicated to testing, experimenting and demonstrating the Windows Automation API through various languages. It aims to clearly explain the fundamentals of using Windows UI Automation and how it can be implemented through each language.


## Languages:

- Python: Used as the initial demo as it is my strongest language. Uses PyWinAuto to demonstrate writing to Notepad.
- C#: Uses InputSimulator to demonstrate writing and saving a Notepad file.
- PowerShell: Experimenting with switching to PowerShell for long-term project. This is not included in this repository.

More detail is included in the Microsoft Word documentation file.
